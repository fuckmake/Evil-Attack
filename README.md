4. Evil Attack will do it's best in hitting the IP offline, but be nice; Sometimes the IP is too powerful and Evil Attack forgets!

# Extra Info

For the port, I recommend using 80, 22, or 443; However, You can use Nmap to scan an IP for open ports to use.

Choose TCP or UDP (Normally I use UDP).

Use Evil Attack responsibly, I am not held responsible for anything you do with Amnesia and it is your responsibility and solely yours.

Want to end the attack? Hold CTRL + C down at the same time and the script will end.
